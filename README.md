### What is Neumann? 
Neumann, named after Hugarian-American Mathematician John Von Neumann, is a simple application which displays and dictates short philosophical aphorisms, interesting facts about our brain and psychology, and cognitive biases that can distort how we approach problems. 

### Why was it built? 
Neumann was built for anyone searching for wisdom. German Poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe put it succintly when he observed, "The person who cannot live on 3,000 years of knowledge is living hand to mouth." I don't want you to end up in such a sad state. I will do what I can to acquaint you with your historical roots. It is the only way to become a human being. It is the only way to become more than a naked ape. It is the only way to avoid floating in a vacuum.

In our age where society seems to demand us to become hyper-specialized, it is becoming harder to see the forest from the trees. Have you ever run into an individual who was well-educated but at the same time seemed....off? Or how about a person who cannot seem to see a problem from an opposing point of view? It also seems our society has trouble finding nuance in any given situation, which can lead to black and white thinking and the breakdown of good-faith discourse between rational individuals. Neumann was built to help people learn what wisdom is and how to think clearly, in the hopes that their interactions with others may become more meaningful or at least, more understandable. After all, as Philosopher/Emperor Marcus Aurelius observed, "Humans are made for one another; therefore either make them better, or bear with them."

As Neumann will sometimes explain, bite-sized and repeated chunks of information are easiest for us to remember. One of the advantages of Neumann is that it can distill very powerful themes and ideas from some of the world's greatest thinkers into very small bits of observations which are easy to understand and to digest. After all, who has time to read "On the Genealogy of Morality", "Meditations", "The Analects", "Emile," etc., etc. No one! We all have to do taxes, and commute to work, attend to our children, do our homework, and struggle to keep our heads above water! No one has time or brain power left over to explore more abstract concepts, and yet I am convinced doing so is absolutely essential. As Neumann will sometimes say, "Things which matter most must never be at the mercy of those which matter least." 

### How do you use it? 
Neumann was made for people with ADD (like myself) in mind. You can use it for 30 seconds or 30 minutes and still come away with a kernel of truth that perhaps makes your day brighter or your thinking clearer. When we study for a test, we might try to memorize important bite-sized chunks of information so that they become readily acccessible to us when needed. In this manner, Neumann is a study-guide for would-be philosophers, neuroscientists, moral psychologists, or anyone who wants to understand other people and human thought better.

As Confucius said, "Attack the evil that lies within yourself, rather than the evil that lies within others." Next time you feel like compulsively checking Twitter even though you checked it five minutes ago, I would encourage you to fire up Neumann for 90 seconds instead. I would argue that those 90 seconds will be more fulfilling!
